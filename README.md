# Rust Agent Runtime

A durable task-state baseline for a bounded coding-agent runtime.

The first milestone intentionally contains no LLM and no arbitrary shell execution. It provides append-only task events, idempotent enqueue, attempts, cancellation, and restart recovery that requeues interrupted running tasks.

```bash
cargo test --locked
```

The bounded executor rejects program paths and non-allowlisted programs, canonicalizes the working directory under the configured workspace, kills timed-out children, disables stdin, and truncates captured stdout/stderr at a configured byte limit. These controls are not an OS sandbox and do not yet isolate network access or child-process trees.
